	<title> Creating New Elements, Appending Child & Removing Child </title>

	<!-- JavaScript createElement() method : This method is used to create the specified HTML Element Nodes from scratch (here we are creating new h2 and p tags).
		We don't need to specify the position because, these new Elements automatically gets added after the last HTML Element..

	- appendChild() method : With this method, we can attach our newly created HTML Element as a Child of Parent HTML Element.  Remember, in the hierarchy of 
	   HTML, everything is about Parent Element & Child Element..

	- createAttribute() method : This method is used to create the Attribute Node that we want to add to the HTML Element, we just need to pass the name of the 
	   Attribute to create..

	- setAttributeNode() method : This method adds an Attribute Node to an HTML Element  & replaces existing Attribute Nodes.  You must 1st use createAttribute()
	   method & set its value using value property before adding an Attribute to an Element..
	NOTE:- Attribute Node is not a Child of Element Node, but it is part of the Element Node, so we don't need to use appendChild() method after creating Attrib

	- createTextNode() method : To Access the Attributes & Text of our HTML code, the concept of Nodes is used & 3 types of Nodes are there- the Element Node,
	   the Attribute Node  & the Text Node.  Everything in HTML document is a Node  & they have a Parent-Child relationship. The Text Node is at the bottom of
	   HTML hierarchy & cannot have a Child. The createTextNode() method is used to create the Text Node of our newly created HTML Element. After this, we need 
	   to call the appendChild() method to attach the Text Node to our newly created Element Node, because the Text Node is always a Child of Element Node.. 

	- removeChild() method : This method is used to remove a Child from the Parent Node, returns null if child does not exist..

	-- parentNode property : In HTML hierarchy everything is Parent Element & Child Element. This property is used to get the Parent Node of the specified Node.
	   This property is Read-Only..	   -->
